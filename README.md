How to use github:
1. edit web files in editor of your choice
2. upload or edit web files on this repository
3. login to digital-ocean server
4. type cd /var/www/html/
5. type git pull
6. refresh https://okproject.ca (might need to go to incognito mode)


You can 'commit' directly to this repository or you can make a 'pull' request. Pull requests are better because we can review the changes. Consult the documentation for more information but github is pretty easy to use.
